# üë®‚Äçüíª Code Challenge

### Context

There are three files: `jobs.json`, `companies.json`, and `locations.csv`. You will need to load these files, join them on the relevant fields, and answer the questions below. You can use any tool or combination of tools with which you are familiar, however **Python/Jupyter**, **Power BI**, and **SQL** are most relevant to this position.

---

### Questions

Be prepared to discuss:

- How the data was loaded.
- Data quality issues found and how they were discovered.
- How you found answers to the questions below (and any caveats to the answers).

1. **Which location currently has the most jobs in either the active or expired state?**

2. **In which month were the most jobs cancelled?**

3. **Which company has the highest ratio of posted jobs to employee count?**

4. **Develop the SQL to define a dimensional model schema for this data. Document (or be ready to discuss) any design decisions that you make.**

5. **Using your dimensional model, write a SQL query that returns a list of jobs for each company, ordered and enumerated within each group by the `posted_at` date.**

6. **Discuss how you would obtain and model information (within your schema) about the duration of jobs (from posted to expired states).**

7. **(For Data Analyst Role) Provide a visualization showing the trend of the number of active jobs over time. Also include the company name data in this visualization.**
